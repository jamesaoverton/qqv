This document presents a series of examples
of a proposed new way to model quantitative and qualitative values
in the context of the Open Bio Ontologies (OBO).

## Technical Stuff

This document is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) notebook.
First let's get some technical bits out of the way,
such as specifying some classes, object properties,
and data properties to reuse below (in YAML format).

```{python}
from display import display

context = """
classes:
  Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae): NCBITaxon:9238
  attribute: :attribute
  assay: OBI:0000070
  characteristic: PATO:0000001
  data item: IAO:0000027
  entity: BFO:0000001
  g: unit:g
  genotypic sex: PATO:0020000
  male genotypic sex: PATO:0020001
  mass: PATO:0000125
  mass measurement assay: OBI:0000445
  normal mass: PATO:0045030
  value: :value
object properties:
  has characteristic: RO:0000053
  has value: :hasValue
  is about: IAO:0000136
  has specified output: OBI:0000299
  specifies value: :specifiesValue
data properties:
  has quantity: :hasQuantity
  has unit: :hasUnit
short:
  Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae): Adelie Penguin
reverse:
  - has specified output
  - specifies value
  - measures attribute
loose:
  - is about
"""
```

You can view each example as a diagram,
in Turtle syntax,
or in a human-readable YAML syntax
that was used to generate both the diagram and the Turtle.

## Characteristics

One of the simplest things we can say in OBO
is that an entity has a characteristic,
using the 'has characteristic' relation.
Here we have

- two very general classes: 'entity' and 'characteristic'
- an instance of the 'entity' class named 'e'
- an anonymous instance of the 'characteristic' class
- one relation between the instances: 'has characteristic'

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: e
type: entity
has characteristic:
  - type: characteristic
""")
```

## Attributes

Some characteristics are fundamental to what an entity is.
Every penguin has body mass.
Every penguin has a genotypic sex.
By knowing that something is a penguin,
we automatically know that it has these characteristics.
Let's call these characteristics 'attributes',
and introduce a 'has attribute' relation
to relate an entity to one of its attributes.

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: e
type: entity
has attribute:
  - type: attribute
""")
```

## Values

Other characteristics can be different
at different times or under different conditions.
This particular penguin might be male,
and it might have a body mass of 3750g.
We expect that its genotypic sex won't change,
but we know that its body mass will change.
Let's call these characteristics 'values'.

Every value is a more specific form of an attribute.
A penguin always has one body mass attribute,
and that attribute has values
at different times and under different conditions.

We'll intoduce a 'has value' relation
between an attribute and one of its values.

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: e
type: entity
has attribute:
  - type: attribute
    has value:
      - type: value
""")
```

## Penguin Sex

Say we're studying penguins on an island.
We give names to the penguins we're studying,
and we name one of the "N1A1".
N1A1 is male (i.e. has a male genotype).
We say that N1A1 'has attribute' a 'genotpic sex',
and that attribute 'has value' a 'male genotypic sex'.
Since we don't need to say anything more
about these characteristics,
we'll leave them anonymous.

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: N1A1
type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
has attribute:
  - type: genotypic sex
    has value:
      - type: male genotypic sex
""")
```

## Penguin Mass

We can also talk about N1A1's body mass
using a 'mass' attribute and value.
We might just want to say that its mass is "normal".

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: N1A1
type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
has attribute:
  - type: mass
    has value:
      - type: normal mass
""")
```

This is an example of a "categorical" value,
because it specifies that the attribute falls into a broad category.

## Scalar Values

In order to specify scalar values such as "3750g"
let's introduce 'has quantity' and 'has unit' relations
that let us get more specific about values.

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: N1A1
type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
has attribute:
  - type: attribute
    has value:
      - type: value
        has quantity: 3750
        has unit: g
""")
```

## Penguin Mass in Grams

We say that N1A1 has a body mass of 3750g like this:
  
```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: N1A1
type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
has attribute:
  - type: mass
    has value:
      - type: mass
        has quantity: 3750
        has unit: g
""")
```

Note that the attribute and the value belong to the same class 'mass',
but we use the 'has quality' and 'has unit' data properties
to make the value more specific than the attribute.

## Penguin Mass Data

In our example we *measured* N1A1's body mass.
In OBI we call that measurement process a 'mass measurement assay',
which outputs an IAO 'data item',
which 'is about' the material entity that was measured.
  
```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
- subject: N1A1
  type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
  has attribute: _:N1A1_mass_attribute
- subject: _:N1A1_mass_attribute
  type: mass
  has value: _:N1A1_mass_value
- subject: _:N1A1_mass_value
  type: mass
- subject: _:N1A1_data_item
  type: data item
  is about: N1A1
- subject: _:N1A1_mass_assay
  type: mass measurement assay
  has specified output: _:N1A1_data_item
""")
```

Unfortunately, the 'is about' relation is not telling us much.
There's no connection between the value
and the assay that measured it.

We should have a few more relations:

1. specifies value: from the data item to the value that was measured
2. specifies value: from the assay to the measured attribute that was measured
3. measured by: from the value to the assay that measured it

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
- subject: N1A1
  type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
  has attribute: _:N1A1_mass_attribute
- subject: _:N1A1_mass_attribute
  type: mass
  has value: _:N1A1_mass_value
- subject: _:N1A1_mass_value
  type: mass
  measured by: _:N1A1_mass_assay
- subject: _:N1A1_data_item
  type: data item
  specifies value: _:N1A1_mass_value
- subject: _:N1A1_mass_assay
  type: mass measurement assay
  has specified output: _:N1A1_data_item
  measures attribute: _:N1A1_mass_attribute
""")
```

Now the 'data item' isn't telling us much.
By omitting it, we get a much clearer picture,
with all the information that we're likely to need.

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
- subject: N1A1
  type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
  has attribute: _:N1A1_mass_attribute
- subject: _:N1A1_mass_attribute
  type: mass
  has value: _:N1A1_mass_value
- subject: _:N1A1_mass_value
  type: mass
  measured by: _:N1A1_mass_assay
- subject: _:N1A1_mass_assay
  type: mass measurement assay
  measures attribute: _:N1A1_mass_attribute
""")
```

We could also infer 'measures attribute'
as the inverse of the two functional relations
'has value' + 'measured by'.

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: N1A1
type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
has attribute:
  - type: mass
    has value:
      - type: mass
        measured by:
          - type: mass measurement assay
""")
```

So the general case would be:

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: e
type: entity
has attribute:
  - type: attribute
    has value:
      - type: value
        measured by:
          - type: assay
""")
```
