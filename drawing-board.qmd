This document presents a series of examples
of a proposed new way to model quantitative and qualitative values
in the context of the Open Bio Ontologies (OBO).

## Context

First let's define some classes, object properties,
and data properties to reuse (in YAML format).

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
from display import display

context = """
classes:
  Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae): NCBITaxon:9238
  characteristic: PATO:0000001
  entity: BFO:0000001
  g: unit:g
  male genotypic sex: PATO:0020001
  mass: PATO:0000125
  normal mass: PATO:0045030
object properties:
  has characteristic: RO:0000053
  has value: :hasValue
data properties:
  has quantity: :hasQuantity
  has unit: :hasUnit
short:
  Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae): Adelie Penguin
"""
```

## Characteristics

One of the simplest things we can say in OBO
is that an entity has a characteristic,
using the 'has characteristic' relation.

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
type: entity
has characteristic:
  - type: characteristic
""")
```

## Penguin Sex

Given an Adelie Penguin "N1A1",
we can say that it is male
by saying that it 'has characteristic'
an (anonymous) 'male genotypic sex' characteristic.

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: N1A1
type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
has characteristic:
  - type: male genotypic sex
""")
```

## Penguin Mass

We can also talk about N1A1's body mass
using a 'mass' characteristic.

```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: N1A1
type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
has characteristic:
  - type: mass
""")
```

We usually want to say more than just "N1A1 has mass" --
we want to say that the mass is normal,
or is 3750g.

## Values

## Scalar Values



## Penguin Mass in Grams



  
```{python}
#| output: asis
display(context, """
subject: N1A1
type: Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
has characteristic:
  - type: mass
    has value:
      - type: normal mass
        has quantity: 3750
        has unit: g
""")
```
